# Lunar

Lunar is a decentralized explorer application built on top of [Arweave](https://arweave/org) and [AO](https://ao.arweave.net). It provides an interface for discovering, inspecting, and interacting with messages exchanged across the AO network. By surfacing AO messages and processes, Lunar aims to improve traceability for users of the network, and developer utility for building their permaweb applications.
